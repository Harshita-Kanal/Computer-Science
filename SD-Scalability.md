## Vertical scaling
* Optimize processes and increase throughput using the same resource

## In a system
* Keep backups and avoid single point of failiure
* Proper scheduling of cron job
* Allocate more resources
* Microservice architecture: All components have their well defined responsibility
* Distributed system: Fault tolerant and lesser response times
* Central place routes requests
* **Load Balancing**: Route requests in a smarter way
* **Decoupling**: Seperation of concerns to handle responsibilities effectively
* Logging and metrics
* Keep the system extensible

## HLD vs LLD
* Low level design: convert design to code
